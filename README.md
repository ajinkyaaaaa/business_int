House cost analysis and prediction

This project involves the analysis of the factors affecting the cost of a house in a particular state/city/country. I have used a random dataset from kaggle for 
this project. It consists of a lot of highly significant variables like longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedroom, ocean_proximity etc 
and this dataset was highly used so i went ahead with this. The visualizations and the ML models used in this little project are all listed in the code with their 
respective accuracy scores, with XGB with hyper parameter tuning coming out on top. This project was fun but time consuming, got to know a lot of new things along 
the way..! Hope this helps!
